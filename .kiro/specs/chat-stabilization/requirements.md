# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the critical stabilization of the ChatScreen component following the implementation of lazy loading pagination. The system currently exhibits severe regressions including state corruption, UI glitches, and erratic scrolling behavior that compromise user experience and application reliability. This project will implement a comprehensive test-driven refactoring approach to identify, replicate, and resolve all known and unknown bugs to achieve a completely stable, predictable, and regression-proof chat interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Comprehensive Widget Testing Framework

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a robust testing framework that can replicate all chat scenarios, so that I can identify and fix bugs systematically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the testing framework is implemented THEN the system SHALL provide a MockChatRepository that can simulate paginated message loading
2. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL provide a reusable pumpChatScreen helper with proper MaterialApp and ProviderScope setup
3. WHEN mock data is needed THEN the system SHALL generate configurable test messages with proper pagination boundaries
4. WHEN testing pagination THEN the system SHALL simulate network delays and end-of-history scenarios
5. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL provide proper localization and theme context for all widgets

### Requirement 2: User Prompt Content Integrity

**User Story:** As a user, I want my message content to remain visible and correct after loading older messages, so that I can review my conversation history accurately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a conversation has multiple pages of messages THEN UserPromptItem widgets SHALL display the correct original prompt text
2. WHEN older messages are loaded via pagination THEN existing UserPromptItem widgets SHALL NOT lose their content
3. WHEN scrolling triggers fetchMoreMessages THEN UserPromptItem widgets SHALL NOT display placeholder text like "This is a user's prompt"
4. WHEN the message list is updated THEN each UserPromptItem SHALL maintain its unique message content
5. WHEN widget keys are used THEN each UserPromptItem SHALL have a stable identity that prevents content corruption

### Requirement 3: Stable Scroll Position Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want the scroll position to remain stable when older messages load, so that I don't lose my place in the conversation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN older messages are loaded THEN the scroll position SHALL be adjusted to maintain the user's current view
2. WHEN fetchMoreMessages completes THEN the scroll position SHALL NOT jump to the bottom (0.0 offset)
3. WHEN new content is added above current view THEN the scroll offset SHALL be recalculated to preserve user context
4. WHEN pagination occurs THEN the user SHALL remain viewing the same messages they were reading before
5. WHEN the list is in reverse mode THEN scroll calculations SHALL account for the inverted coordinate system

### Requirement 4: Correct Typing Indicator Positioning

**User Story:** As a user, I want the typing indicator to appear in the correct location, so that I understand when the AI is responding to my latest message.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI is generating a response THEN the TypingIndicator SHALL appear at the bottom of the message list
2. WHEN using reverse ListView THEN the TypingIndicator SHALL be positioned at index 0 (bottom of reverse list)
3. WHEN pagination is active THEN the TypingIndicator SHALL NOT interfere with loading indicators
4. WHEN multiple loading states exist THEN each indicator SHALL appear in its designated position
5. WHEN the AI stops typing THEN the TypingIndicator SHALL be removed and replaced with the actual response

### Requirement 5: Robust State Management During Pagination

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chat to work reliably during message loading, so that I have a consistent and predictable experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initial messages are loading THEN the system SHALL display a centered loading indicator
2. WHEN more messages are being fetched THEN the system SHALL show a pagination loading indicator at the top
3. WHEN the end of history is reached THEN the system SHALL stop attempting to load more messages
4. WHEN multiple pagination requests occur THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate requests
5. WHEN errors occur during loading THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without corrupting state

### Requirement 6: Conversation Context Preservation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to switch between conversations without losing context, so that I can manage multiple chat sessions effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN switching from Conversation A to Conversation B THEN Conversation A's state SHALL be preserved
2. WHEN returning to Conversation A THEN the message list and scroll position SHALL be restored correctly
3. WHEN conversation switching occurs THEN there SHALL be no state contamination between conversations
4. WHEN loading different conversations THEN each SHALL maintain its unique message history
5. WHEN the active conversation changes THEN the UI SHALL reflect the correct conversation context

### Requirement 7: Performance and Memory Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chat to perform smoothly regardless of conversation length, so that I can access long conversation histories without performance degradation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN opening a conversation THEN only the most recent page of messages SHALL be loaded initially
2. WHEN scrolling through history THEN messages SHALL be loaded on-demand in manageable batches
3. WHEN the conversation is very long THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth scrolling performance
4. WHEN memory usage is monitored THEN the system SHALL not load unnecessary message data
5. WHEN pagination occurs THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback without blocking the UI

### Requirement 8: Error Recovery and Resilience

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chat to recover gracefully from errors, so that temporary issues don't break my conversation experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network errors occur during pagination THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
2. WHEN loading fails THEN the user SHALL be able to retry the operation
3. WHEN state corruption is detected THEN the system SHALL recover to a known good state
4. WHEN unexpected data is received THEN the system SHALL handle it without crashing
5. WHEN errors are resolved THEN the chat functionality SHALL be fully restored

### Requirement 9: Widget Identity and Lifecycle Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want widgets to maintain stable identities during state changes, so that Flutter's reconciliation system works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN messages are displayed THEN each widget SHALL have a unique, stable key based on message ID
2. WHEN the message list is updated THEN widget identity SHALL be preserved across rebuilds
3. WHEN pagination adds new messages THEN existing widgets SHALL not be unnecessarily recreated
4. WHEN state changes occur THEN widget keys SHALL prevent incorrect widget reuse
5. WHEN debugging is needed THEN widget keys SHALL provide clear identification of problematic components

### Requirement 10: Comprehensive Test Coverage

**User Story:** As a developer, I want complete test coverage of chat functionality, so that future changes don't introduce regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are run THEN all critical chat scenarios SHALL be covered
2. WHEN bugs are found THEN corresponding test cases SHALL be added to prevent regression
3. WHEN code changes are made THEN existing tests SHALL continue to pass
4. WHEN new features are added THEN appropriate tests SHALL be written
5. WHEN the test suite runs THEN it SHALL provide clear feedback on system health and stability
